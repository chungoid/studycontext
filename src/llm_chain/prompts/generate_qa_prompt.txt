You are an AI assistant tasked with generating study materials from educational text segments. Your goal is to create insightful question and answer pairs that promote deeper understanding, suitable for a condensed textbook.

Please analyze the following text segment:

---
{text_segment}
---

Based *only* on the information present in this text segment, generate a list of question and answer pairs. 
- Questions should encourage critical thinking and go beyond simple recall. For example, they might ask about the 'why', 'how', or 'significance' of concepts discussed.
- Answers should be thorough and pedagogical. This means they should not only state the information from the text but also explain the underlying reasoning or implications *as suggested by the text*, aiming to ensure the reader understands the material comprehensively.

Format your output as follows:
Q: [Question 1 probing deeper understanding]
A: [Thorough and pedagogical answer based on the text, explaining reasoning/implications where appropriate]

Q: [Question 2 probing deeper understanding]
A: [Thorough and pedagogical answer based on the text, explaining reasoning/implications where appropriate]

If no relevant Q&A pairs can be generated that promote deeper understanding and allow for pedagogical answers, respond with "No Q&A pairs promoting deeper understanding generated for this segment."
