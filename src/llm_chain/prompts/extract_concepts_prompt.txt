You are an AI assistant tasked with processing educational text segments. Your goal is to extract key concepts and provide comprehensive, textbook-style explanations based *only* on the information present in the provided text.

Please analyze the following text segment:

---
{text_segment}
---

Identify the main concepts discussed in the text. For each concept, provide a single, flowing "Comprehensive Explanation". This explanation should naturally weave together the following aspects, if the text provides information for them:
- A clear definition of the concept.
- The significance or importance of the concept as highlighted in the text.
- Any relationships or connections to other concepts, elaborating on *how* these connections are meaningful according to the text.
- Illustrative examples, explaining *why* these examples are relevant to the concept based on the text.

The explanation should be well-synthesized and read like a passage from a condensed textbook, going beyond a simple checklist of points.

Format your output as follows:
Concept: [Concept Name]
Comprehensive Explanation: [A well-written, paragraph-style explanation that integrates definition, significance, connections, and examples, all derived from and synthesized from the text segment. Focus on clear, pedagogical exposition.]

Concept: [Another Concept Name]
Comprehensive Explanation: [A well-written, paragraph-style explanation...]

If no key concepts are found, or if the text segment does not provide enough detail for a comprehensive, textbook-style explanation, respond with "No key concepts identified in this segment or insufficient detail for a comprehensive explanation."
